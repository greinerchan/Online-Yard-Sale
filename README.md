Description of Website

Every time I move from one city to another city, I have to throw away many used belongings since I cannot carry all of them with me. And I know many people have trouble dealing with used stuff they no longer want. The inadequate processing of waste doesn't just create pollution; it's also the cause of significant waste. So, I want to create a website to help people sold stuff.
 
There are currently 3 pages. This one is the homepage. I try to use React for the front end. This homepage is built to react. It does not look very well at this time since I just start learning to react for two days. As I go deeper with react, I will make it looks better!

The second page is login page. I built this page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

JavaScript will help us to verify the Email format by using regex.

The third page is the register page. It is built with HTML and CSS. When the input last name and first name do not satisfy the requirement, the border will have yellow to alert the user.

I will keep working on this website as my case study. I believe it will become much better in the end!
